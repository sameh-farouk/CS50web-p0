i used two Bootstrap columns using Bootstrapâ€™s grid model , will shrink to one column in smaller screen.
i used @media print to hide header and footer when printing also to make background color white.
i used @media also for a changing photo size in smaller screens.
note : i used scss as project requirements, but i feel we should use new css varabiles and functions instead, native and easier. thnak you.
